We find the robots.txt pages and we have two things:

User-agent: *
Disallow: /whatever
Disallow: /.hidden

We go check the whatever page, and we find one file "htpasswd".

He have this:
root:437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49

Ok it's look's like a password hash so let's try tool to crack password.
We can use john but also a simple online tool like https://crackstation.net/

437394baff5aa33daa618be47b75cb49 -> md5 -> qwerty123@

So now we have an id and a password:
root
qwerty123@

Let's try them on sign in page.
Not working on sign in page.
We find the /admin/ page so let's try on it.

Done
