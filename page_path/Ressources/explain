Most page are indexed with ?page=<name> in the uri
When we try to change <name> with a non existing page we get a 'WTF ?' alert from the server
Just after putting '../../' as name the message WTF change for 'WRONG..'
Seems wird so i continue to go deeper back
After going deep back we get always the same message 'You can DO it !!!  :]'
Didn't search a lot before trying '/etc/passwd'

Done
