We try to send an exploit to upload file page.
But if it's not an image file the website don't take it.
So we send an image and with burp we intercept the POST request.
Then we can modify the file, the name and the content.

We try with a exploit.php file
With content:
<?php echo file_get_contents('/etc/passwd'); ?>
We send it and we get the flag has answer.

Done
