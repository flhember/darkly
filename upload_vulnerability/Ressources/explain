We try to send an exploit to upload file page.
But if is not a image file the web site don't take it.
So we send an image and with burp we get the POST request.
And we can modify the file, the name and the content.

We try with a exploit.php file
With content:
<?php echo file_get_contents('/etc/passwd'); ?>
We re send this an we have :

<h2 style="margin-top:50px;">
